  displayText: 'The Wendigo


    Danger level: S-


    Scientific name: SCP-323-1


    I
    have never seen such a fast creature. This wendigo is by far one of the most
    relentless creatures I have encountered. We couldn''t get away from it, even
    when we tried to lock a metal door behind us, it just bashed its head against
    it, sending it flying. The only thing that can stop this thing is those big steel
    doors.


    It does seem like it gets slower and slower over time, as if they
    can''t survive without constant meat consumption. It was limping, and we saw
    it take down a zombie and eat it. Jess shot it with a shotgun, and it didn''t
    even seem phased. Then it got up, and the limp was gone, like it recovered completely
    from just one meal.


    Jess cut her arm up really bad, and we could just hear
    the thing howling behind a blast door trying to get to her like it smelled her
    blood.


    We finally killed it, and one of the newbies just pulled the skull
    off its head and started bashing his head into it, trying to fit it in. We just
    had to get out. We left him behind. I hope we never see that thing again.
