    Danger level: -A+


    Scientific name: SCP-427-1


    I
    don''t think I have ever seen a monster this weird in ages, I found this monster
    after David left with this weird necklace thing he found, he said it made him
    fell better, so who was I to say that I should put it away, but either this monster,
    killed David or it is David, This monster has some weird habit of picking up
    scrap and throwing it at us, but after that it will just throw us around.

    We
    did try to take it down with Violence, but not even Gus had the strength to take
    this thing down.


    But by total accident Vanessa dragged this monster and
    it ran over some mines and it got blown to hell, it seems that explosions are
    the only way to take these things out

    But after closer inspection it does
    seem like it is the necklace, I gave it to a lootbug and well.


    The necklace
    and monster are connected but I just think I will stay away from both
